"""
A simulation environment for a mobile robot operating in two dimensions.

The Environment class models the world that the robots navigate in. The world is continuous and two-dimensional. The world possesses an outer border, internal obstacles, and identifiable landmarks. The world also manages the passage of time and the motion of robotic agents within the world over time.

Critically, the environment tracks the robot's state. In this case, the robot's state is a vector that includes three state variables: x position, y position, and heading.
